# 🏫 Learn@Home: Tutoring Platform

## 📄 Introduction
Learn@Home is a digital platform with a mission to connect students who require academic assistance with volunteer tutors. Our objective is to make remote tutoring accessible to every student, irrespective of their location. Each student registered on Learn@Home is paired with a volunteer tutor who helps them with weekly sessions, homework, and organization.

## 📋 Project Management
The development process follows agile methodologies. We utilize a Kanban board to categorize the project into blocks of functionalities and sub-functionalities, moving them from "To Do", to "In Progress", to "Testing", and finally to "Done".
